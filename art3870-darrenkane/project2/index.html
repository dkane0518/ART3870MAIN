      <h3>Introduction to Vegan Sushi</h3>
      <p>Sushi is a great, healthy fast food. There are plenty of sushi take out places where you can buy rolls stuffed with veggies, tofu and avocado, but it's actually very easy - and cheaper if you eat a lot - to make your own. A lot of supermarkets now sell sushi ingredients so you don't have to go looking too far. It's important that you use sushi rice so that the rolls hold together. Experiment with different fillings.

     <h3>Preparation</h3>
     <p>1. Buy bonafide sushi rice from the Asian market (or aisle).
I struggled to make sticky rice with other types of rice to clean out my pantry. But there’s something particular about the starchy exterior of sushi rice that gives it the perfect texture. Bonus—it’s not that pricey and comes in a huge bulk sack.

2. Start with skinny toppings, like cucumbers, carrot sticks, and tofu slices.
Once you’ve gotten the hang of rolling up the sushi, turn to more formidable fillings like soft avocado and fluffy lettuce. It tries to escape!

3. Keep a dish of water with a few tablespoons of rice vinegar nearby for sealing the rolls.
Dip your fingers into the dish and sprinkle the vinegar water on the edge of the nori before sealing it up.

4. Make sure your hands are wet while you’re handling the rice.
You’ll have a dish of water with a few tablespoons of rice vinegar handy for sealing the rolls. Before you handle rice, dip your fingers into this mixture. Keeps you from becoming Edward Sticky Rice Hands!

5. Use leftover veggies!
Roll up roasted vegetables or leftover salad to save time. Just make sure to slice them in thin strips.

6. Slice with a very clean serrated knife to keep from smashing the rolls.
It’s easy to destroy your handiwork by squishing your sushi roll into more of a sushi disk if you use a dull knife. Use a serrated bread or sandwich knife using a gentle but fast sawing motion instead of mashing down with all your might. Pro tip: Rinse and dry the blade between rolls so it doesn’t get sticky and snag when you try to make clean cuts. Or sprinkle some of that vinegar water on the blade!

     <h3>Recipe</h3>
     <p>FOR THE SUSHI RICE<br>

1 cup sushi rice<br>
1 cup water<br>
1 teaspoon rice vinegar<br>
1 teaspoon sugar<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
FOR THE ENOKI MUSHROOMS<br>

7 ounces bundle of enoki mushrooms, broken into 8 pieces (keep base intact)<br>
1 cup water<br>
2 TB Ener-G<br>
1 cup cornstarch, plus more if needed<br>
plenty of canola, vegetable or grapeseed oil<br>
TO ASSEMBLE<br>

4 toasted nori sheets<br>
4 TB white sesame seeds (optional)<br>
4 TB vegan mayo (I used Follow Your Heart’s Vegenaise)<br>
4 TB sriracha<br>
8 shiso leaves<br>
1 TB black sesame seeds, to garnish
     </p>

    <p>


      INSTRUCTIONS<br>

To make the sushi rice, place the rice and water into a rice cooker and cook according to the manufacturer instructions. Once done, season with the rice vinegar, sugar and salt and set aside to cool.<br>
To make the mushrooms, place several inches of oil into a small, heavy dutch oven or cast iron pot (I use Lodge’s cast iron) over medium-high heat. It will take anywhere from 5-7 minutes for the oil to be ready. While you are waiting, whisk together the water and Ener-G in a small, shallow bowl, then throw two of the enoki pieces into the mixture and toss to coat. Shake off any excess moisture, then place into the cornstarch, gently tossing with your hands.<br>
Test the oil for readiness by throwing in a pinch of cornstarch. If it sizzles immediately, you are ready to fry. Shake off any excess cornstarch from the mushrooms (See Figure 1 above), and gently lower them into the oil using a skimmer and fry about 3 minutes, turning occasionally in the oil. Transfer the fried mushrooms to a paper towel and sprinkle immediately with a little salt and allow to drain while you repeat the process in batches with the rest of the mushrooms.<br>
To assemble the rolls, divide the cooled rice into 4 portions. Slide a sushi mat into a large Ziploc bag or cover with plastic wrap. Place one sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the mat. Moisten your fingers with some water to prevent rice from sticking to them, then spread the rice evenly over the nori sheet, leaving about an inch exposed at the top. Sprinkle with one tablespoon of the sesame seeds, if desired.<br>
Mix the sriracha and mayo together. Place one tablespoon of the sauce in a line across the rice on the end closest to you. (See Figure 2 above.) Place a shiso leaf at each end of the roll. Slice off the tough base at the end of the mushroom, then place 2 enoki pieces at the end, ovrlapping the shisho leaf. (See Figure 3 above.) Roll the sushi away from you, gripping the mat tightly but gently.<br>
Once rolled, seal the end with water or add a few grains of rice to the end to help seal. Now cut the sushi in half with a very sharp knife (I run the blade under scalding water for a cleaner cut), then each half into halves, then those halves into halves to make 8 pieces.<br>
Repeat the process to make 4 rolls. Place onto a serving plate, drizzling with a little extra sriracha-mayo and black sesame seeds, if desired.
